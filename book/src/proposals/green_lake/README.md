# Create a protected path on Aurora along the west side of Green Lake Park

In summer 2021, a two-way protected bicycle path opened around the east half of Green Lake. It's almost possible to bike around the entire lake without mixing with motor vehicle traffic. But there is a gap on the west side of the lake, and that's what we'll explore today.

In fact, this idea was pitched ??? by Seattle Greenways and GLW Streets: https://www.glwstreets.org/aurora-park-path

This will be a different sort of transportation advocacy article -- we're going to use A/B Street, software that simulates traffic in Seattle and helps understand possible effects of adjusting streets. We're going to use data to argue for fixing this missing path, but we don't want to get bogged down by data. Traffic impact studies make many assumptions, and we shouldn't require one to justify this change. Our hope is that A/B Street can help people understand the problem and visualize the solution better.

## The problem

Suppose you want to 

use cases... and an argument about high demand there?

### Option 1: the dangerous dirt path

bumpy and not wide
somebody got hit there!
video/pictures

### Option 2: the inner trail

Due to COVID, Seattle Parks banned biking and clockwise walking on the inner trail. In late June 2021, it's possible this restriction will be lifted. But even pre-pandemic, taking this inner trail was pleasant for a leisurely ride, but it was nowhere near a commute route. The trail is technically segregated for people roller-blading and biking, but in practice, crowds walk across the entire trail.

### Option 3: Linden and Winoa

hill and the door zone
show lane configuration
video
waiting at lights
big arterial intersections?

this is probably?? the one people will take in abst
show individual problems
show aggregate problems -- risk?

## Solution

Show how to make the edits

what about the sidewalk?

what about biking south along this? need to connect the slip lane

### Measuring impact

individual people happier

unintended consequences

### Arguments against

Will the bus be routed there again?

How much to install the jersey barrier?

WSDOT / SDOT jurisdiction?

## Appendix: modelling assumptions

- behavior near some of the crazy intersections isnt realistic, silly backup
- untimed lights
- no thru traffic -- including on aurora!
- the lane-changing behavior isnt super realistic anyway
- induced demand
- mode shift
- parking
