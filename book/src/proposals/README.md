# Proposals

The whole point of A/B Street is for people to suggest real fixes to their city,
so here's the list. In most cases, we're not yet able to use A/B Street itself
to illustrate the problem or solution -- but that shouldn't stop this list from
starting.

If you want to add anything here, contact us!

## Seattle

Disclaimer: currently this is just one person's (Dustin) list, so it reflects my
experiences and biases. South Seattle is conspicuously missing -- I need to go
explore more.

Safety problems biking:

- Airport Way southbound from ID to Georgetown. The right lane has a huge
  shoulder; at least paint a bike lane
- Broadway bike lanes missing between Highland and John
- Partitioning off a lane of Aurora at Green Lake west, proposed by Seattle
  Greenways
- Bike lanes vanishing halfway up Harvard to Roanoke
- The massive intersection where the Burke Gilman meets Corliss
- No passing room on Fuhrman/Boyer

Antagonistic traffic signal timing:

(Why are these important: they're hopefully a cheap change, and problems here
add up, making driving the most convenient option.)

- Northbound on 11th after the University Bridge
- Turning left from 11th Ave NE to Ravenna
- The double crosswalk at Montlake / Husky Stadium
- Cherry and 12th; long cycle time for people crossing near Seattle University
- Yesler and Broadway slow beg buttons
- Unmarked beg buttons around Beacon Hill, and no bike actuators
- Beg buttons along Interurban near Bitter Lake

Larger changes:

- Cafe/bus street along University Ave
- Eastlake cycle lanes

## London

There's some idea related to a
[cycle-path on the A5](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet/issues/577)

## Template

Over time, each idea will link to a full write-up. That page can have any
format, but I imagine this basic structure is useful:

- Describe the problem
  - A clear map showing the scope of the issue
  - Include pictures and videos from a physical survey, or maybe annotated
    satellite imagery
  - Use A/B Street to demonstrate the problem for individual people or in
    aggregate
- Describe the proposed solution
  - Ideally A/B Street is useful for visualizing the change, and measuring
    quantitative results.
  - Explain any limits with the modelling
- Give context on the problem
  - Is this being discussed anywhere -- often on Twitter?
  - Are there other proposals or write-ups?
- Give arguments against the proposed solution
  - Unintended consequences, prohibitive costs, alternate routes available
