# Funding

A/B Street is almost entirely unfunded / self-funded. All contributors volunteer
their time; thank you!

Funding received:

- Contract with [ActDev](https://actdev.cyipt.bike/)

Dustin has personally funded two open-source libraries needed by A/B Street, but
hopefully usable by other projects:

- [fast_paths Rust contraction hierarchy pathfinding](https://github.com/easbar/fast_paths/)
- [Python elevation data processing](https://github.com/eldang/elevation_lookups)
