# Collaborations

We're working with a few different groups on projects using A/B Street.

## GLT

Active as of Sept 2020

[Green Lights Trading](https://www.greenlightstrading.com) is applying dynamic
congestion caps to encourage drivers to find alternate routes, not drive during
rush hour, or take public transit instead. I'm actively implementing a
proof-of-concept in A/B Street. It could also be used to explore ideas like a
downtown congestion charging zone for Seattle.

## Xi'an

Active as of Sept 2020

A group (with their own demand data!) is studying traffic signal optimization in
Xi'an. They're using the [API](../dev/api.md).

## Forecasting group

Active as of Sept 2020

A research group is making a bunch of live map edits and scheduling new trips in
the middle of a simulation and using their system to try to predict system-wide
effects. They're also using the API.

## CityEngine

Stalled as of Sept 2020

Edits in A/B Street could be exported to the
[shared-row](https://github.com/d-wasserman/shared-row/) format, then rendered
in 3D using
[ArcGIS CityEngine](https://github.com/d-wasserman/Complete_Street_Rule). Not
blocked on us.

## Berlin

Stalled as of Sept 2020

A group wants to use A/B Street for various public engagement projects in
[Berlin](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/119). Mostly blocked on
getting a reasonable travel demand model.

## Manchester

Stalled as of Sept 2020

A group tentatively wants to engage the public about preventing rat runs and
making no-through-access zones in Manchester suburbs. Not really blocked on us
yet.

## Pandemic model

Stalled as of Sept 2020

A group from the Uni of Geneva started a
[COVID-19 model](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/tree/master/sim/src/pandemic)
that figures out how long people spend in shared indoor spaces.
