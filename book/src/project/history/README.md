# Project history

As of June 2020.

tldr: A/B Street has been in active development since June 2018, but the idea
has been festering since I was about 16.

## Retrospective

What poor judgments have cost me the most time?

- UI churn: I should've studied some UX on my own and started with a clear idea
  of how to organize everything
- OSM data quality: I should've gained the confidence to upstream fixes earlier
- Intersection geometry: I should've realized sooner that simulation robustness
  is more important than nice appearance.
- Geometry primitives: I sunk too much time into the polyline problem and f64
  precision.

## Trivia

- The name was almost "Unstreet" or "Superban" (superb urban)
- I hope you enjoy and/or are baffled by the
  [release names](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases)
